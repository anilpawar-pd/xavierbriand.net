Increment and decrement number with vim
=======================================

As you already know, **vim** [#vim]_, it's great!

To simply increment and decrement a number, you just have to put your
cursor on the right number and press ``CTRL+A`` to increment or ``CTRL+X`` to decrement.

You can suffix this command with a number to change the step.
